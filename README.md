Low-level rust bindings for [tilengine](http://www.tilengine.org/).

Requirements
====

* Rust 1.37 or later
* [Tilengine](http://www.tilengine.org/)

Documentation
====

All functions are the same ones exported from [Tilengine](http://www.tilengine.org/doc/index.html). Use their documentation for what the functions do and the rust foreign function interface to access and call the functions. (See the [examples](https://github.com/mc1472/rust-tilengine-sys/tree/master/examples) to get an idea of how it works.)
